# PasswordPro
The free, simple, open-source password generator

# What is PasswordPro?
Well, PasswordPro is a simple password generator, made solely with Python.

By the way, if you are wondering why it says "PassyV2" in the pictures, it's because that was the program's old name because it is now called PasswordPro. :)

# Prerequisites:
- You must have the latest version of Python on your computer. You can get it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- ...And that's it!

# How to try it out

First, click on the "Download Code" green button above the repository.

Then, go to control panel > programs and features > and check to see if Python is installed.
# If Python is not installed...
Make sure the default downloads directory is set to the Downloads folder, and then double-click on the file called "installpython+runpasswordpro.bat". This will download python from the python website, run the installer, and then run PasswordPro.
# If Python is installed...
1Double-click on the "runpasswordpro.bat" file to run PasswordPro. Alternatively, you could just go to the "V1.0" folder and double click on the "passwordpro.pyw" file.

....And that's it!

Thank you very much for trying out my program, this is the first project I have made on GitHub :)

# PasswordPro
The free, simple, open-source password generator

# What is PasswordPro?
Well, PasswordPro is a simple password generator, made solely with Python.

By the way, if you are wondering why it says "PassyV2" in the pictures, it's because that was the program's old name because it is now called PasswordPro. :)

# Prerequisites:
- You need to have Windows 7 or above on your computer.

# How to try it out

# METHOD 1: ONLY USE IF YOU DON'T HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED!

1) First, go to the Releases page of this repository and download ALL THE FILES into your downloads folder.

2) Now, double-click on the batch file named "installpython+runpasswordpro.bat" and run it. If it says windows protected your PC or something, don't worry. Just click "more info" and click "run anyway" as the script is completely harmless.

You should then be greeted with a message and a prompt saying "press any key to continue". Now, press any key to continue after you have read the message.

It will then redirect you to your web browser to download the Python exe file from the Python website. It will now appear in your downloads folder.
